# The meaning of Searching

Searching in C++, this is the process of finding a certain data item from a given list of values, this process is called searching. The searching process is considered successful if the specified data item is successfully found during the searching process in C++ otherwise, if the specified data item is not found then the result is declared unsuccessful. The search operation comes to an end or is terminated when the specified item is found. This may also be possible that more than one instance of the searched item may be present in the provided list.

Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

## 1.Sequential Search:
In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: **Linear Search**.

Using sequential search, the following procedure is adopted:


## 2.Interval Search:
These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: **Binary Search**.
