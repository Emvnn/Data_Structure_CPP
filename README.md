# The meaning of Data : 

Since the invention of computers, people have been using the term "Data" to refer to Computer Information, either transmitted or stored. However, there is data that exists in order types as well. Data can be numbers or texts written on a piece of paper, in the form of bits and bytes stored inside the memory of electronic devices, or facts stored within a person's mind. As the world started modernizing, this data became a significant aspect of everyone's day-to-day life, and various implementations allowed them to store it differently.

Data is a collection of facts and figures or a set of values or values of a specific format that refers to a single set of item values. The data items are then classified into sub-items, which is the group of items that are not known as the simple primary form of the item.

Let us consider an example where an employee name can be broken down into three sub-items: First, Middle, and Last. However, an ID assigned to an employee will generally be considered a single item.

# The meaning of Data Structure :

Data Structure is a branch of Computer Science. The study of data structure allows us to understand the organization of data and the management of the data flow in order to increase the efficiency of any process or program. Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in the memory of the computer so that these data can easily be retrieved and efficiently utilized in the future when required. The data can be managed in various ways, like the logical or mathematical model for a specific organization of data is known as a data structure.

The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory . Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially,i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory.

# The scope of a particular data model depends on two factors:

First, it must be loaded enough into the structure to reflect the definite correlation of the data with a real-world object.

Second, the formation should be so straightforward that one can adapt to process the data efficiently whenever necessary.
Some examples of Data Structures are Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue, Trees, etc. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science, i.e., Compiler Design, Operating Systems, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and many more.

"Data Structures are the main part of many Computer Science Algorithms as they allow the programmers to manage the data in an effective way. It plays a crucial role in improving the performance of a program or software, as the main objective of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible."
