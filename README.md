Since the invention of computers, people have been using the term "Data" to refer to Computer Information, either transmitted or stored. However, there is data that exists in order types as well. Data can be numbers or texts written on a piece of paper, in the form of bits and bytes stored inside the memory of electronic devices, or facts stored within a person's mind. As the world started modernizing, this data became a significant aspect of everyone's day-to-day life, and various implementations allowed them to store it differently.

Data is a collection of facts and figures or a set of values or values of a specific format that refers to a single set of item values. The data items are then classified into sub-items, which is the group of items that are not known as the simple primary form of the item.

Let us consider an example where an employee name can be broken down into three sub-items: First, Middle, and Last. However, an ID assigned to an employee will generally be considered a single item.
